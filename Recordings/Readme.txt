This dataset has text excerpts from Alice in Wonderland, represented in UTF-8 format strings, encoded in audio files in
two different encodings. Some files are encoded in a pulse encoding where each of eight frequencies represents one bit in a byte,
some are encoded in a chirp encoding where an upwards chirp represents bit 1 and a downward chirp represents bit 0.

The recorded sounds contain a full set of messages. The files are all 44,1kHz 16bit PCM audio. 
The rceordings are named in the following way:
